**About the project :**

This responsive web application solves one of the most common problems faced by college students everywhere. The central idea is to help students look for a place to live. The application will match the student with an appropriate roommate according to their preferences. The web application requires an account creation.  The application consists of two kinds of users, students owning a room and looking for roommates as well as students who need a place to stay. Preferences need to be filled out in both cases in order to enable the process of matching with a roommate.

**To Run the We Application :**

Just run the python file 'Contoller.py' and the web server is activated. To check if the web app works you can either SignUp or login using an existing user credentials :
user email : pc@gmail.com
user password : pcnick123
